1) Fork the repository you want so you have your own version to work on.

3) Clone your repo by using terminal.  This brings the repo file to your local computer.  Copy the Github repo URL.  Use the terminal command: git clone url

4) Create a branch using the terminal command:  git checkout -b ‘first name-lastname’

5)  Make changes to your code in VSCode.  Save file.

After changes are made, COMMIT often.  

6) Use the terminal to stage your commits.  Use the terminal command:  git add

7) Then use terminal to commit.  Include a descriptive commit message that describes the changes.  In the terminal type: git commit -m ‘descriptive commit message’

8) When you are ready to push your local changes to the cloud and your remote repo branch, you will use the following terminal command:  git push

9) In Github you will create a pull request.  This is made from your branch, against the fork you created.
